# PI-routeer
We configured Raspberry PI to function as a Enterprise Network Device. Functions include, PI as Router, WLAN/Access Point, FTP and Web Server, DHCP and DNS Server, Firewall, Back-Bone routing and ISP. Each PI will be configured to perform all the above mentioned function and Router will route packets between all the above PI's to form a Enterprise Network. Each PI will be able to access or get service from each other PI for Functionality. Example: If a PI wants to access a FTP Server, it contacts the FTP server, router between the FTP and Client PI will route packets between client and server.   My part was to configure PI as Router, DHCP Server, DNS Server.
